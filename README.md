# BITBOT – Lego plotter/printer

## 🖊️ About the Project
BITBOT is a robotic plotter/printer built with LEGO Mindstorms that can write user-inputted text. It was created as a competition project for **Robotiáda**, combining mechanical precision with modern programming.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **🧩 Hardware**: LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 with **ev3dev (Linux)** OS
- **🦀 Programming Language**: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) – fast, safe, and efficient
- **🖥️ Framework for the Desktop App**: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) *(This GitHub repository contains only the Rust code for controlling the robot; the desktop app is separate.)*

## 🎯 Why BITBOT?
Our goal was to create a project that is not only practical but also demonstrates the capabilities of Rust when integrated with LEGO Mindstorms. BITBOT is designed to be intuitive to control, enabling precise text writing on paper with minimal effort. Developed specifically for Robotiáda, this project highlights the seamless fusion of software and mechanical engineering, showcasing the potential of combining modern programming with robotics.
